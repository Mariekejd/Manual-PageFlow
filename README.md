# üìö PageFlow Manual

This manual explains how to build a PageFlow prototype using a NodeMCU, an LED strip, WiFi, and the Open Library API.
The goal is to visualize reading progress with LED lights.
This prototype focuses on the WiFi + API + LED feedback part of the concept.

## üß† Concept

The original idea involves giving reading feedback through a smartphone screen.
In this prototype, the feedback is simulated through LED colors and the serial monitor.

The NodeMCU connects to WiFi.
- It requests book data from the Open Library API (or a different API with book data).
- It reads values such as title and number of pages.
- It shows simple feedback using LEDs.

## üß∞ Materials

- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- LED strip
- WiFi connection
- Open Library API ‚Üí https://openlibrary.org/developers/api

## üí° LED Strip Setup
1. Connect Din (yellow) to D1 on the NodeMCU.
2. Connect +5V (red) to a 3V pin on the NodeMCU.
3. Connect G (black) to G next to the 3V pin.
 
## üåê Step 1: Connect to WiFi

This step sets up the NodeMCU to connect to a WiFi network.

```cpp

#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>

const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI";
const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  Serial.print("Connecting to WiFi");
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  Serial.println("\n‚úÖ Connected!");
}

void loop() {}

```
